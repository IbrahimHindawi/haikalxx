# haikalxx
Don't wanna use STL and RAII.
haikalxx is a templated data structures library that uses arena allocation.
haikalxx is based on [haikal](https://github.com/IbrahimHindawi/haikal) which is built with C and is C++ compatible.
# how to run:
Just include `inc` and `#include` whatever `h` file you want to use.
